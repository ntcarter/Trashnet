So far a databse named 'test' has been created with 2 tables: events and devices

Here are the statments that were used to create these tables;

CREATE TABLE devices (
	ID int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	Location varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    DateInstalled date NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);


 CREATE TABLE events (
	ID int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	DeviceID int NOT NULL,
	EventName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    OccuranceTime datetime NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (DeviceID) REFERENCES devices(ID)
);

These tables are by no means final, however if you wish to change these tables please either let get everyone in the group's approval or create a new database with the modified tables.

to add a row to the devices table:

insert into devices (Location , DateInstalled)
VALUES('East Side','2018-01-24');

to add a row to the events table:


insert into events (DeviceID, EventName, OccuranceTime)
VALUES(3,'trash recieved', '2018-1-26 03:23:45');
